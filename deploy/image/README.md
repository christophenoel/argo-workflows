# Docker Image Deployment for [Project Name]

## Overview
This document outlines the Docker image configuration and deployment instructions for [Component Name]. It includes details on building the Docker image, running containers, and handling common configurations.

## Building the Docker Image

To build the Docker image, navigate to the directory containing the `Dockerfile` and run the following command:

```bash
docker build -t [your-image-name]:[tag] .
```

Replace `[your-image-name]` with the appropriate name for your Docker image and `[tag]` with the desired version or tag.

## Running the Docker Container

Once the image is built, you can run a container based on that image with the following command:

```bash
docker run -d --name [your-container-name] -p [port]:[port] [your-image-name]:[tag]
```

Replace `[your-container-name]` with a name for your container, `[port]` with the appropriate port numbers, and `[your-image-name]:[tag]` with the image name and tag used in the build step.
