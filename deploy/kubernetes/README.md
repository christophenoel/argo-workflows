# Kubernetes Configuration for [Project Name]

## Overview
This document provides an overview of the Kubernetes configurations used for deploying and managing [Component Name]. It includes details on deployment manifests, service definitions, and other Kubernetes resources critical to the operation of the component.

## Configuration Files
Below is a list of key Kubernetes configuration files included in this directory:

- **`deployment.yaml`**: Defines the Deployment configuration for [Component Name].
- **`service.yaml`**: Specifies the Service configuration that provides network access to the component.
- **`ingress.yaml`**: (Optional) Manages external access to the services, typically via HTTP.
- **`configmap.yaml`**: Contains non-confidential data in key-value pairs that can be consumed by pods.
- **`secret.yaml`**: Manages sensitive information, such as passwords and API keys, used by the component.

## Deployment
To deploy the component to a Kubernetes cluster, use the following command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

## Services
To establish the network access to the component, apply the service configuration:

```bash
kubectl apply -f service.yaml
```

## Scaling
To scale the component, adjust the `replicas` field in the `deployment.yaml` file or use the following command:

```bash
kubectl scale deployment [deployment-name] --replicas=[number]
```

## Updating
To update the component, modify the relevant Docker image or configuration and apply the changes:

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

## Cleanup
To remove the deployed resources from your cluster, use:

```bash
kubectl delete -f .
```
