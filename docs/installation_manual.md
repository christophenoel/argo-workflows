# Installation Manual

## Overview

This manual provides comprehensive guidance on how to install and set up Argo Workflow. Ensure all prerequisites are met before proceeding with the installation.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin the installation, ensure that the following software is installed and configured on your system:

- Docker
- Kubernetes
- Helm
- Argo CLI

NB: Argo CLI can be downloaded from here: https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/releases/

## Build Procedure

NO Build process required.

## Deployment

This project uses Helm for deployment on Kubernetes. Follow the steps below to deploy the application using Helm charts.

Make sure Helm is installed and set up correctly. For installation instructions, see the [official Helm documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).

```




### Verifying the Installation

Ensure the installation was successful, by submitting a workflow to Argo:

```
argo -n argo-helm submit --serviceaccount executor https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/master/examples/hello-world.yaml --watch
```

### Addition configuration

#### Label Kubernetes nodes

Labels associated with nodes are used by Argo Workflows and Kubernetes to choose on which node a pods must be scheduled.
Here is an example of how to associate a label with a node:
```
kubectl label nodes <node-name> accelerator=<my-label>
```

To list labels associated with nodes:
```
kubectl get nodes --show-labels=true
```

## Troubleshooting

Offer common issues and solutions encountered during the installation process.

### Custom resource Definition (CRD) already defined
Custom resource Definition (CRD) are defined cluster wide and not bound to a namespace. This can cause a conflict when installing multiple instances of Argo Workflows within the same Kubernetes cluster.
If CRD are already installed on the Kubernetes cluster, and you donâ€™t want/need to change those, you can install Argo and skip the CRD installation like this:
```
helm install --namespace argo-helm argo-workflows argo/argo-workflows --version 0.41.4 --set crds.install=false
```

## Uninstall
```
helm uninstall --namespace argo-helm argo-workflows
kubectl delete namespace argo-helm
```
